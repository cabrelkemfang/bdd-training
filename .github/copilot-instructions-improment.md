Analyze the codebase and identify areas of improvement. 

Create a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks and save it as an enumerated checklist to `docs/tasks.md`. 
Each item should start with a placeholder [ ] to be checked off when completed.
Ensure the tasks are logically ordered and cover both architectural and code-level improvements.


Iteratively implement the improvements based on the task list in `docs/tasks.md`. 
After completing each task, mark it as done by changing the checkbox from [ ] to [x]. 
Ensure each change aligns with the style guidelines in `.github/git-commit-instruction.md` and the improvement plan in `docs/plan.md`.
